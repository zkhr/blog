    <div class="blog-date">2023-07-30</div>

    <div class="section">
      I've got a bunch of random ideas for projects in my notes. Here are a few
      of the more interesting ones.
    </div>

    <div class="section-header">Cookbookbook</div>

    <div class="section">
      Cookbookbook would be a "social" website for recipes. I know there are
      millions of cooking websites out there already (I even briefly had a food
      blog ~10 years ago).
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      But searching, collecting, and sharing recipes is an awful user experience
      today. Really, I want something web-based and text-focused like HN or
      Tildes but for recipes.
    </div>

    <div class="section-header">Cracking the coding interview for kids.</div>

    <div class="section">
      As a new dad, I've gotten to read a lot of really fun kids books. I
      thought it might be cool to try and make one which takes concepts from
      coding interview prep like leetcode or cracking the coding interview, and
      turns it into bite-size books that kids can still enjoy while parents
      learn something new! Not sure if this is an amazing idea or some sort of
      SF tech bro dystopian one.
    </div>

    <div class="section-header">TypeWriterScript</div>

    <div class="section">
      It took my longer than I care to admit to remember what I meant by
      TypeWriterScript in my notes.
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      I <i>think</i> that the idea here was writing a language that could
      compile to TS that looks like this:
    </div>

    <pre class="code-block">
# Hello World

This is an example of a hello world in TypeWriterScript.

  console.log("Hello World!");
    </pre>

    <div class="section">
      The idea here is that the documentation (either in plaintext or markdown
      maybe) and the code are one in the same, but written with the docs being
      any unindented lines. The indented lines would be valid TS.
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      Essentially, I could write a blog post that is perfectly valid
      TypeWriterScript.
    </div>

    <div class="section-header">Sherwalk Holmes</div>

    <div class="section">
      Credit for the name on this one goes to my amazing wife.
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      This would be a mobile game that uses your daily step count to solve
      Sherlock Holmes mysteries. Your step count would be used to power Holmes
      traveling around London getting clues to solve the crimes (so you can play
      at home or wherever).
    </div>

    <div class="section">Anyways, that's it for ideas for now.</div>
