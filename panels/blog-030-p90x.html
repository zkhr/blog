          If our society seems more nihilistic than that of previous eras,
          perhaps this is simply a sign of our maturity as a sentient species.
          As our collective consciousness expands beyond a crucial point, we are
          at last ready to accept life's fundamental truth: that life's only
          purpose is life itself.

      In 2011, I'd graduated college and moved out to California with a few
      boxes and a duffel bag. After living on my own a bit realized, "Yeah,
      guess I should probably work out".

      But this was the tail end of the era of dvds. Netflix had some streaming
      options, but not everything was available there yet. I had to wait for
      episodes of Dexter to show up in the mail one disc at a time.

    <div class="section">
      So I bought the p90x dvds. And now in 2025, I've forgotten how many times
      I've stopped and started and just pushed play.

    <div class="section">
      Sometimes I complete all 90 days, sometimes I don't. Sometimes I stream
      the workouts, sometimes I put the dvds in a PS3 or PS4.

      I can't write something positive about Tony and p90x without the Beachbody
      caveat. Their content is good. Great. Shaun T, Vytas, and others have
      created a lot of fun, engaging workouts and programs.

      Back in 2015 (and then again in 2018), a small group of us had a bet with
      the following rules:
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <ul>
        <li>
          Every time a daily workout is missed, you must put $5 into the pot.
        </li>
        <li>
          You cannot do a workout until all previous workouts have been
          completed.
        </li>
        <li>
          First person to finish 90 days wins the entire pot. If multiple people
          finish the same day, the pot is split.
        </li>
        <li>
          X Stretch is not required (but recommended) on “Rest or X Stretch”
          days.
