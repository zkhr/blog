I ran into this by accident when playing around with styles for my site awhile
back. Turns out this specific optical illusion is more pronounced for
near-sighted individuals when wearing glasses. An oddly specific super-power.

Here's an example:

<div class="chromostereopsis-demo"></div>

If you don't see the illusion, the red parts seemingly jump out of the screen,
and the blue parts are sunken further back. If you search around on the
internet, there are tons of cool examples that people have made running with
this technique.
