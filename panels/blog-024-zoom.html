      If you're on desktop, you can now zoom in and out on the grid with the
      <span class="inline-code">[</span> and
      <span class="inline-code">]</span> keys.

      I'd previously toyed with animations that would zoom in and out when
      navigating far distances on the grid, but never settled on one that I
      liked. This feature takes inspiration from that, letting you just zoom in
      and out as you please.

      At 3 levels of zoom, the performance of the page is a little janky, but
      not so bad that I want to do further rendering improvements (above and
      beyond the switch from position offsets to css transforms in this commit).
