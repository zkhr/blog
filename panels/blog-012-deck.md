With a nearly 3 month old at home, portable pausable gaming has allowed me to
relax during my downtime when the little guy naps or feeds, but still lets me
jump in on a moment's notice. After a couple of months doing this on the switch
(with games like
<a class="link" data-x="2" data-y="-2">pokemon scarlet</a> and
<a class="link" data-x="3" data-y="-4">monster sanctuary</a>) or on my phone
with
<a class="link" data-x="2" data-y="-3">board game arena</a>, I decided to unlock
my steam library and pick up a deck.

And I enjoy using it immensely! The biggest technical issue I've encountered
involves the screen not turning back on after sleeping, but with its short boot
times, that issue hasn't bothered me too much.

So far, I've played a few games on it. I tried out Desk Job, replayed some Hades
and Cozy Grove, delved into the newer acclaimed Vampire Survivors, and took my
Civ VI turns in my play by cloud games with friends.

I even got ff14 working on it to catch up on the 6.3 main story! While reluctant
to move from M+KB to controller gaming for an MMO, I've picked it up quicker
than I thought I would, and actually prefer it for a few things already. Maybe
not for extreme trials, but I'm mostly doing solo content anyway right now (so I
can pause whenever I need to).

Not sure what I'll play next, but studios have packed February with new games up
my alley. Hogwarts Legacy comes out on Feb 10, Theatrhythm Final Bar Line on Feb
16, and Octopath Traveler 2 on Feb 24. And in the latest Friday Facts, Twinsen
announced controller support for Factorio is
[on its way](https://www.factorio.com/blog/post/fff-372), so I've got that to
look forward to at some point, as well.
