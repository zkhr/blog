It has been an amazing 11.5 (!) year run at Alphabet, by my access was just cut
off and my role eliminated.

# Why are you leaving?

"Local Remote" work is
[going away](https://www.theverge.com/google/684966/google-buyouts-search-org)
and I've declined the ask to RTO. I would prefer to work somewhere with a
remote-friendly culture. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

One of my awesome past teammates has also shared some
[interesting thoughts](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/04/technology/tech-jobs-silicon-valley-changes.html?unlocked_article_code=1.bk8.kIdk.4WNFoSSDZM_M&smid=url-share)
on Google in 2025.

# What do you plan to do next?

No immediate plans yet, I intend to take some time off between roles hanging out
with my very nearly 3 year old.

And maybe travel a little bit or work on some personal projects. I'll probably
update this journal more frequently.
