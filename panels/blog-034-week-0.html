      As mentioned in
      <span class="link" data-x="5" data-y="-6">an update on</span> last week, I
      left my job.
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      After over a decade working for <i>the company</i>, there's a lot I'll
      miss. But the three at the top of my mind right now are:
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <ol>
        <li>
          My phenomenal coworkers, who I learned so much from over the years
        </li>
        <li>My work notes/journals, which I no longer have access to</li>
        <li>Memegen.</li>
      </ol>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      There's not much I can do about (1) and (3) right now, but for (2), I've
      started using <span class="emphasis">Obsidian</span> to keep daily notes
      of what I'm working on, design docs for side projects, and miscellaneous
      learnings as I navigate the tech stacks I'm
      <a href="https://github.com/jhuangtw/xg2xg">less familiar with</a>.
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      This journal entry is a collection of various interesting (to me) notes
      from my personal logs over the last week.
    </div>

    <div class="section-header">Project ideas</div>

    <div class="section">
      The hardest part of a new project is coming up something that lies in the
      intersection in the venn diagram of being
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <ul>
        <li>An interesting idea to work on</li>
        <li>A tech stack that I either know really well or want to learn</li>
        <li>Something that others would find fun or helpful to use</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      I had an idea in
      <span class="link" data-x="0" data-y="-6">project ideas i</span> called
      <span class="emphasis">Sherwalk Holmes</span> that I've started tinkering
      with, since it seems like it <i>might</i> hit all those criteria.
    </div>

    <div class="section-header">The Web</div>

    <div class="section">
      I switched over to the <span class="emphasis">Vivaldi</span> browser,
      since I no longer work at <i>the company</i> and Safari and Chrome both
      have issues that I find aggravating.
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      For example, in Safari, dynamic favicons on desktop often show stale
      versions of themselves, due to how they're cached. See
      <a
        href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/339350/safari-12-favicon-in-gmail-tab-shows-incorrect-e-mail-count"

      >
      on Stack Overflow from 2018! On mobile, I'll frequently get into a state
      where the back button navigation is buggy.
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      In Chrome, more and more AI features are getting pushed into the browser
      layer, which is not my preference. On the other hand, Vivaldi has
      explicitly <a href="https://vivaldi.com/for-a-better-web/">stated</a>:
      <i
        >"We donâ€™t buy into the idea that everything needs to be powered by AI.
        Especially not the kind that uses your data without permission, or
        plagiarizes and pollutes the web with misinformation."</i

    </div>

    <div class="section">
      That said, I really like the look of the liquid glass version of mobile
      Safari in the iOS 26 dev beta. I might be convinced to switch back to
      that...
    </div>

    <div class="section-header">Vim keybindings</div>

    <div class="section">
      It's funny (to me) that one of the first things I have to switch over in
      any new text editor (Obsidian, XCode, VS Code, etc) is to vim keybindings.
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      I say that as I'm typing this journal entry in vim.
    </div>

    <div class="section">Muscle memory is a crazy thing.</div>

    <div class="section-header">Swift</div>

    <div class="section">
      My first impressions of developing in Swift are mostly positive. I like a
      lot of the syntactic sugar that it has (guard clauses, for-when, implicit
      member expression (aka the leading dot syntax), etc).
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      It sucks that I have to fallback from SwiftUI to UIKit for some seemingly
      obvious things (e.g. changing the tint color of indicators in a
      <code>TabView</code>).
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      There is a mix of really solid documentation and tutorials, and absolute
      garbage that hasn't been updated as functionality changes. For example, I
      banged my head longer than I care to admin on installing custom fonts,
      because
      <a
        href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/applying-custom-fonts-to-text/"
        >the official docs</a
      >
      are wrong! You don't specify the full path to the font. Just the filename.
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      If you somehow made your way to this journal post from a search just
      because of this issue, let me give you more details. The
      <i>Fonts provided by application</i> under
      <i>Custom iOS Target Properties</i> on the Info tab should just be the
      filename of your font, irregardless of where in your directory structure
      the file is. Also note that you have to edit it via that menu, if you
      update the <code>Info.plist</code> manually, it won't work.
    </div>

    <div class="section-header">What's up next?</div>

    <div class="section">
      I've got some basic data models and the intro flow of Sherwalk, as well as
      the ability to pull step count data from HealthKit, and some minimal mocks
      in Figma done already. I hope to get an end-to-end demo out this week in
      the hands of some of my friends for some early testing and feedback.
