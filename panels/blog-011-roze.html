          By creating a planetary network, mankind on Planet now has the ability
          to share information at light-speed. But by creating a single such
          network, each faction has brought themselves closer to discovery as
          well. At the speed of light, we will catch your information, tag it
          like an animal in the wild, and release it unharmed-if such should
          serve our purposes.

      Over the pandemic, I've played a few asynchronous games of Civ 6 with
      friends, using discord to keep track of whose turn it is. We wanted a way
      to automate @mention'ing the next player, so we looked around.

      There are a few github repos that have this functionality that you can
      clone and run with, and there is an often cited
      <a

        >reddit post</a

      that explains how to set up IFTTT for this, but there wasn't an easy way
      to add a bot to your server and have it "just work".

      Introducing, <a href="https://roze.run">roze.run</a>, the self-proclaimed
      "premier way to get turn notifications in Discord for Sid Meier's
      Civilization VI". This was a fun weekend project, in that there are only a
      few moving parts, but it gets the job done! Well mostly, Civ's webhook
      system has a bunch of issues that can actually make it kinda flaky, but
      under certain circumstances it works well.

      This project is named after Datatech Sinder Roze from the Alien Crossfire
      expansion of one of my favorite games of all time:
      <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/sid_meiers_alpha_centauri"
        >Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri</a
      >. As an aside, if you like 4x games and haven't played it, do yourself a
      favor, close this blog, and buy it now. It is often on sale on gog and at
      time of writing it is only $1.49. I've easily spent hundreds of hours over
      the last two decades on this one game.
