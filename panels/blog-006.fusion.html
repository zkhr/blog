      Congratulations to the folks over at
      <a href="https://www.llnl.gov/">LLNL</a> for their news yesterday on

      <div class="quote">
        LLNLâ€™s experiment surpassed the fusion threshold by delivering 2.05
        megajoules (MJ) of energy to the target, resulting in 3.15 MJ of fusion
        energy output, demonstrating for the first time a most fundamental
        science basis for inertial fusion energy (IFE).
      </div>
      So, why is this milestone exciting? Let's dive in.
    </div>

    <div class="section-header">Why pursue fusion energy?</div>
    <div class="section">
      Looking at the U.S. Energy Information Administration's
      <a href="https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=427&t=3"
        >electricity generation by energy source</a
      >
      in the United States for 2021, roughly 4.11 petawatt hours were generated
      with ~60% coming from fossil fuels, ~20% from nuclear energy, and ~20%
      from renewables.
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      Fusion energy, often relegated to the realm of science fiction, has
      significant advantages over the nuclear and fossil fuel categories.
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      In comparison to nuclear energy, there is no risk of catastrophic
      meltdown, the raw materials are abundant, and the nuclear waste is minimal
      and decays relatively quickly.
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      When considering the looming effects of climate change, traditional fossil
      fuels like oil, natural gas, and coal become a lot less attractive.
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      So fusion energy, when available, could easily fit inside a portfolio of
      cleaner energy solutions like wind, hydropower, solar, biomass, and
      geothermal.
    </div>

    <div class="section-header">What are the ongoing fusion efforts?</div>
    <div class="section">
      One of the more popular approaches (with a few dozen around the world),
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokamak">tokamak</a> devices work
      to study fusion by generating a powerful magnetic field to confine the
      fusion fuel.
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      On the other hand, LLNL's
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Ignition_Facility"
        >National Ignition Facility</a
      >
      (NIF) pursues fusion by means of inertial confinement (i.e. using energy
      from lasers instead). I'm not a nuclear physicist, so I won't go into more
      details than <b>magnets</b> vs <b>lasers</b>, but check out LLNL's article
      on
      <a href="https://lasers.llnl.gov/about/how-nif-works">How NIF Works</a>
      for some interesting background.
    </div>
    <div class="section-header">Yesterday's announcement and what's next</div>
    <div class="section">
      In the announcement yesterday, NIF successfully created 3.15 MJ of energy
      by delivering only 2.05 MJ to the target. This is an awesome milestone,
      with the big caveat that in order to deliver 2.05 MJ of energy, the laser
      system needed ~300 MJ from the grid.
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      So, what's next? Like a tech tree in a video game, achieving fusion energy
      as a long-term power source requires prerequisite research advances in
      many areas. How do we fire shots at a higher frequency? How can we
      increase the yield from the lasers to require less energy from the grid?
      How do we further increase the energy yield? And so on.
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      The joke has been that fusion energy is always a couple decades away, but
      yesterday's milestone truly feels like we've moved one step closer. Who
      knows... ask me again in 2040.
