# wrapped

If I've learned anything from seeing my spotify history over the years, it's
that video games have a lot of really talented music composers — Masayoshi Soken
(FFXIV), Piotr Musiał (Frostpunk), and Danny Baranowsky (Crypt of the
Necrodancer) to name a few.

# adaptive music

One of the details I love in some of my favorite games is when the music
dynamically responds to what I'm doing. For example, listen to the
[battle music](https://youtu.be/xZVb1cozNA4?t=324) in Skies of Arcadia from the
early 2000s as the player enters and exits a crisis.

Other games also make sure that certain beats in boss fights have solid scores
to accompany them. A couple years ago, when I was playing Honkai: Star Rail, the
Cocolia fight had [this moment](https://youtu.be/B-2sUJLKk7s?t=2041) before the
boss's big attack that I really enjoyed.

# clair obscur

I just finished this game a few weeks ago, and I'm still thinking about it.

And Lorien Testard with Sandfall Interactive absolutely nailed the music across
the board. Boss fights, cutscenes, wandering around, whatever. It's so, so good.

The battle at the [end of act 2](https://youtu.be/UUVw37UD9Cc) has one of my
favorite pieces in the game. And of course the
[cutscene](https://youtu.be/o0Ohd6I3Utw?list=RDo0Ohd6I3Utw) in Lumière at the
beginning of the game is unforgettable.

The whole [8+ hour soundtrack](https://youtu.be/LAQZfeETFbg?list=RDLAQZfeETFbg)
is astounding. I hope it wins a million awards and I can't wait to see what else
he composes in the future!
