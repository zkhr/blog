    Several years ago, I created the side project I still use the most.

  <div class="section">
    <b>booggle</b> is a
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boo_(character)">fictional ghost</a>
    inspired web implementation of a
    <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/1293/boggle"
      >popular word game</a
    >
    involving a 4x4 grid of letters. Designed to be played by me and my then
    girlfriend (now wife), it helps kill a few minutes pretty much whenever we
    need.

    The application was built using a minimal
    <a href="https://nodejs.org/">nodejs</a> server (with
    <a href="https://expressjs.com/">express</a>) that tracks users coming and
    going, handles state for games that are in progress, checks words against a
    dictionary as users are playing, and provides scoring at the end.

  <div class="section">
    On the client, I used mostly vanilla javascript with
    <a href="https://handlebarsjs.com/">handlebars</a>. Simple json messages are
    passed between the client and server via a
    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API"
      >websocket</a
    >.

    Want to try it out? It runs over at
    <a href="https://ari.blumenthal.dev/booggle">ari.blumenthal.dev/booggle</a>.
    It's a little buggy, only one game can be played at a time, the dictionary
    isn't perfect, but hey, anyone can play.
