      As mentioned in the
      <span class="link" data-x="1" data-y="-3">new site, who dis.</span> blog
      post, this site is an infinite grid, with each page on the site being a
      panel on that grid. This raises the question, how do I decide where on the
      grid to place new pages?
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      Being an infinite grid, there are infinte number of options! For example,
      we could just go off in an arbitrary direction:
    </div>

    <pre class="grid">
··············
··█───────────
··············</pre
    >

    <div class="section">
      But that doesn't really take advantage of the dimensionality of the grid.
      Instead, we could spiral around a point:
    </div>

    <pre class="grid">
┌─────┐
│┌───┐│
││┌─┐││
│││█│││
│││└┘││
││└──┘│
│└────┘</pre
    >

    <div class="section">
      Or we could use the
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pairing_function"
        >Cantor Pairing Function</a
      >
      or even pick randomly!
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      So, what did I go with? Well, for blog posts, I decided to use the
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_curve">Hilbert curve</a>, a
      space filling fractal, since it
      <a href="https://datagenetics.com/blog/march22013/"
        >has some nice properties</a
      >:
    </div>

    <pre class="grid">
█·······
│┌─x┌─┐┌
└┘┌┘└┐└┘
┌┐└┐┌┘┌┐
│└─┘└─┘│
└┐┌──┐┌┘
┌┘└┐┌┘└┐

</pre

    <div class="section">This blog post is at 'x' on the curve.</div>

    <div class="section">
      If you get lost navigating the grid, you can always grab a
      <span data-loot="map" class="loot">map</span> to check your position.
    </div>

    <div class="nav-section">
      <span class="link nav-link" data-x="0" data-y="0">Home</span>
