          There are two kinds of scientific progress: the methodical
          experimentation and categorization which gradually extend the
          boundaries of knowledge, and the revolutionary leap of genius which
          redefines and transcends those boundaries. Acknowledging our debt to
          the former, we yearn nonetheless for the latter.

      While digging through some files, I found my college transcript from —
      <i>looks at calendar</i> — 13 years ago and thought it might be fun to jot
      down some recollections.

      I took a few AP tests in high school and got out of intro chemistry and
      calculus freshman year. It's still interesting that after a decade or so
      of school before university, a handful of transfer credits from AP tests
      are the only things that carry over.

    <div class="section">
      Hands down, my favorite class at university was
      <span class="tag cs">CS 242</span>. This class had a weekly programming
      assignment that you could solve in any number of ways, but you would have
      to present your solution to a small group of other students and a TA. This
      meant you saw the different ways that everyone in your group approached
      the same problem.
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      Some weeks, the assignment would build up off of the previous week's work
      (without you knowing ahead of time), so if you wrote clean code, you'd be
      better off than if you quickly hacked something together and left yourself
      with a bunch of techdebt.
