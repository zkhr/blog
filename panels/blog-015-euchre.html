      Busy couple of months. Went back to work, moved near family, and the kid
      is almost 8 months old.

    <div class="section">
      In honor of returning to the Midwest, here are the rules I documented a
      few years ago for three-handed euchre:
    </div>

    <div class="section-header">
      3 handed Euchre Rules
      <span class="secondary-text">aka cutthroat euchre</span>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      The game starts with all 3 players at 20 points and is played over a
      sequence of rounds using a deck with 10,J,Q,K,A of every suit and the 9 of
      clubs. The goal of the game is to be the first to get to 0 points.
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      Each round is played as follows. The dealer deals 4 hands of 5 cards (1 to
      each player and 1 face down) and flips the remaining card face up.
      Starting left of the dealer and moving clockwise, players will decide if
      they want <b>the dealer</b> to pick it up and move the card into their
      hand and discard back down to 5 cards.
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      If a player chooses for the dealer to draw that card, that is now the
      trump suit for the hand. If no player calls it up, the card is flipped
      over and you go around the table in the same order picking one of the
      remaining 3 suits. The dealer will be the last to pick and is required to
      pick a suit
      <span class="secondary-text"
        >(this is the screw the dealer variation in the original Euchre, that
        I've always played with in cutthroat).</span
      >
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      Starting with the dealer and going clockwise, each player can decide if
      they want to <b>stay</b>, <b>drop</b>, or <b>take the other hand</b> (if
      the dealer did not take the extra hand). If they stay, they will play with
      their current hand. If they drop, they will not take part in the round. If
      they take the other hand, they must play the current round with the hand
      that was face down. Note that they are playing with that hand sight
      unseen; they can't look ahead of time.
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      All remaining players will play the hand with standard Euchre rules
      <span class="secondary-text"
        >(Jack of the chosen trump suit is highest, Jack of the opposite suit
        but same color is second highest, trump beats nontrump, high beats low,
        etc).</span
      >
      Each trick taken is worth -1 point to your score. Taking 0 tricks is worth
      +5 points. If you called a suit (or told the dealer to pick the card up)
      you must take at least 3 tricks, or the hand is worth +5 points (and you
      get no points for the tricks you took).
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <b>Scoring Example 1:</b> 3 players are playing in the first round; Ari
      dealt the hand and Chad had Ari pick the 10 of clubs up. Ari and Greg both
      stayed and ended up taking 1 trick each, Chad took 3 tricks. So Ari and
      Greg are both at 19 and Chad is at 17
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <b>Scoring Example 2:</b> 1 player is playing in the first round. Ari and
      Chad both dropped and Greg was the only one who stayed in. Greg takes all
      5 tricks and is at 15.
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <b>Scoring Example 3:</b> 2 players are playing in the first round. Ari
      called a suit, Chad stayed in, and Greg dropped. Ari only took 2 tricks,
      and Chad took the remaining 3, so Ari is now at 25 and Chad is at 17.
    </div>

    <div class="section">There are 3 remaining special rules:</div>

    <div class="section">
      <b>9 of clubs round:</b> When the 9 of clubs is the face up card on the
      table, the bidding is skipped. Nobody draws the 9 of clubs, nobody can
      switch hands, clubs are immediately the trump suit, everybody must play,
      and everybody needs to take 1 trick to avoid getting 5 points (nobody is
      required to take 3 tricks)
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <b>9 of clubs trump:</b> 9 of clubs is always the lowest trump card, no
      matter which suit is trump.
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <b>5 points rule:</b> At the start of the hand, if you're at 5 points or
      less, you may no longer drop.
    </div>
