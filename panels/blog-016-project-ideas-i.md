I've got a bunch of random ideas for projects in my notes. Here are a few of the
more interesting ones.

# Cookbookbook

Cookbookbook would be a "social" website for recipes. I know there are millions
of cooking websites out there already (I even briefly had a food blog ~10 years
ago).

But searching, collecting, and sharing recipes is an awful user experience
today. Really, I want something web-based and text-focused like HN or Tildes but
for recipes.

# Cracking the coding interview for kids.

As a new dad, I've gotten to read a lot of really fun kids books. I thought it
might be cool to try and make one which takes concepts from coding interview
prep like leetcode or cracking the coding interview, and turns it into bite-size
books that kids can still enjoy while parents learn something new! Not sure if
this is an amazing idea or some sort of SF tech bro dystopian one.

# TypeWriterScript

It took my longer than I care to admit to remember what I meant by
TypeWriterScript in my notes.

I _think_ that the idea here was writing a language that could compile to TS
that looks like this:

```
# Hello World

This is an example of a hello world in TypeWriterScript.

  console.log("Hello World!");
```

The idea here is that the documentation (either in plaintext or markdown maybe)
and the code are one in the same, but written with the docs being any unindented
lines. The indented lines would be valid TS.

Essentially, I could write a blog post that is perfectly valid TypeWriterScript.

# Sherwalk Holmes

Credit for the name on this one goes to my amazing wife.

This would be a mobile game that uses your daily step count to solve Sherlock
Holmes mysteries. Your step count would be used to power Holmes traveling around
London getting clues to solve the crimes (so you can play at home or wherever).

Anyways, that's it for ideas for now.
