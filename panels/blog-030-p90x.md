      If our society seems more nihilistic than that of previous eras,
      perhaps this is simply a sign of our maturity as a sentient species.
      As our collective consciousness expands beyond a crucial point, we are
      at last ready to accept life's fundamental truth: that life's only
      purpose is life itself.

# 14 years

of watching Tony Horton tell me to do my best and forget the rest.

In 2011, I'd graduated college and moved out to California with a few boxes and
a duffel bag. After living on my own a bit realized, "Yeah, guess I should
probably work out".

But this was the tail end of the era of dvds. Netflix had some streaming
options, but not everything was available there yet. I had to wait for episodes
of Dexter to show up in the mail one disc at a time.

So I bought the p90x dvds. And now in 2025, I've forgotten how many times I've
stopped and started and just pushed play.

Sometimes I complete all 90 days, sometimes I don't. Sometimes I stream the
workouts, sometimes I put the dvds in a PS3 or PS4.

But once again, today is day one.

# MLM

I can't write something positive about Tony and p90x without the Beachbody
caveat. Their content is good. Great. Shaun T, Vytas, and others have created a
lot of fun, engaging workouts and programs.

But beachbody has historically had some very questionable practices like their
MLM business model. Although thank goodness, it seems they
[finally ended it a few weeks ago](https://investors.thebeachbodycompany.com/news/news-details/2024/The-Beachbody-Company-Evolves-Core-Business-Model-with-Updated-Omnichannel-Approach-Focused-on-Accelerating-Path-to-Profitable-Growth/default.aspx).

# Midnight workouts

Back in 2015 (and then again in 2018), a small group of us had a bet with the
following rules:

- Every time a daily workout is missed, you must put $5 into the pot.
- You cannot do a workout until all previous workouts have been completed.
- First person to finish 90 days wins the entire pot. If multiple people finish
  the same day, the pot is split.
- X Stretch is not required (but recommended) on “Rest or X Stretch” days.

Those were definitely the p90x runs where I most consistently worked out.

# Reddit

I had an alt I hardly used named
[u/greenbeansoup](https://old.reddit.com/user/greenbeansoup). Although, I rarely
go on reddit at all anymore after the
[API changes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Reddit_API_controversy) in 2023
(that's around the time I
[dropped](https://github.com/zkhr/blog/commit/80b37cfdaa7cdb30d568d0d1d433b58b08b40b53)
my main handle from the about me page on this blog).
