    <div class="section">
      2022 saw many issues, what with the ongoing covid pandemic, tech layoffs,
      the conflict in Ukraine, and more. But for me personally, it has ended on
      a high being able to spend the last couple months on paternity leave with
      my first kid.
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      The internet loves lists of things, so here are three lists of random
      categories for the year.
    </div>
    <div class="section-header">Video Games</div>
    <div class="section">
      In 2022, I played plenty of games from past years, whether that was trying
      out Seablock in Factorio, thinking I could replay FFXV before my son was
      born (spoiler, he got here 2 weeks early), playing the 6.1 and 6.2 FFXIV
      patches, continuing a very-long-running Gloomhaven campaign with my
      friends, or trying another run of Don't Starve Together with my wife.
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      But, for this category we'll look specifically at my top five games that
      were released in 2022.
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      First, in no particular order, are some runner ups. Games I still enjoyed,
      but didn't make the cut:
      <span class="link" data-x="2" data-y="-2">pokémon scarlet</span>
      the latest entry in the long-running pokémon franchise, the tactical rpg
      <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1850510/TRIANGLE_STRATEGY/"
        >Triangle Strategy</a
      >
      with the Octopath-like HD-2D visual style, the short innovative solitaire
      village builder
      <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1948280/Stacklands/"
        >Stacklands</a
      >, and the donut-based puzzle game
      <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1070790/Freshly_Frosted/"
        >Freshly Frosted</a
      >.
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      Starting at #5 is
      <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1390190/APICO/">APICO</a>, the
      indie beekeeping simulator. It was simultaneously super relaxing, while
      remaining engaging collecting bees and mastering the mechanics of breeding
      and gathering resources. Not to mention an
      <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/7h9h8Wl55sle1g72KRHTrU"
        >awesome soundtrack</a
      >
      by Mothense.
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      At #4, described by Yahtzee in Zero Punctuation as a "post-dad game",
      <a
        href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1161580/Hardspace_Shipbreaker/"
        >Hardspace: Shipbreaker</a
      >
      has you dismantling spaceships for parts in a dystopian capitalist scifi
      future. Like APICO, both relaxing and engaging, but rather than breeding
      bees, the joy came in learning the most efficient way to scrap ships and
      score those sweet credits to slowly chip away at your crippling debt.
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      Coming in at #3 is
      <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1574580/Strange_Horticulture/"
        >Strange Horticulture</a
      >, an occult puzzle game of identifying plants and uncovering plots. I
      loved the user interface of this game that left it to the player to decide
      how to organize their stuff, the overall aesthetic that oozed with charm,
      and the thought that clearly went into designing the different plants and
      their associated puzzles.
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      At #2 is a game that actually came out in South Korea in 2019, but made
      its global debut in 2022.
      <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1599340/Lost_Ark/"
        >Lost Ark</a
      >
      is an Action MMORPG with super fun combat, gorgeous locales, interesting
      characters, and plenty of end-game content. It had different modes that
      were reminiscent of playing Diablo, Monster Hunter, and FF14 all with the
      right mix of challenge and rewards. And not to mention all the mokoko
      seeds and island souls to collect!
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      Last at #1 is
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pokémon_Legends:_Arceus"
        >Pokémon Legends: Arceus</a
      >
      which took a spin on the standard formula of catching pokemon. Running
      around an open world and throwing pokemon balls at unsuspecting monsters
      never got old. Here is the squad that I went with:

    <div class="section">And that's it for games! Up next is TV shows!</div>

    <div class="section-header">TV Shows</div>

    <div class="section">
      For this category, rather than shows that debuted in 2022, I'll consider
      any show that released a new season in 2022. This is purely out of
      convenience, since I didn't watch that many new shows this year.
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      In 2022, I watched a
      <div class="emphasis">lot</div>
      of panel shows, quiz shows, and the like, including the newcomer The 1%
      Club, as well as classics like Jeopardy, Only Connect, QI, 8 out of 10
      Cats Does Countdown, Would I Lie To You, and more. But in honor of Jeremy
      Paxman's last season of hosting, my #5 slot goes to
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_Challenge"
        >University Challenge</a
      >.
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      At #4, I honor a relative newcomer to the online streaming scene with
      College Humor's
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dropout_(streaming_platform)"
        >Game Changer</a
      >. With a recurring cast of amazing comedians and incredibly clever games,
      this show never disappoints. Close runners up are their game shows
      <div class="emphasis">Um Actually</div>
      and
      <div class="emphasis">Dirty Laundry</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      Another dropout show,
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension_20">Dimension 20</a>
      takes the #3 slot, with their 2022 release of
      <div class="emphasis">A Court of Fey and Flowers</div>
      with Aabria Iyengar as GM. I was introduced to this show with
      <div class="emphasis">Escape from Bloodkeep,</div>
      but between
      <div class="emphasis">Fantasy High</div>
      and
      <div class="emphasis">Misfits and Magic,</div>
      this show has hit after hit.
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      At #2 is Netflix's comedy murder mystery
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murderville">Murderville</a>,
      hosted by Will Arnett. Each episode sees a different celebrity try and
      solve a case, having to improvise as they go along. With guests like Conan
      and Kumail Nanjiani, it was a joy to watch. It also introduced me to
      Murder in Successville, which this show was based on.
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      Last but not least, is my #1 pick, the new comedy action anime
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spy_%C3%97_Family">SPYxFAMILY</a>,
      which sees a spy, an assassin, a telepath, and a dog who can see the
      future try and avert war. Hilarious, well animated, interesting
      characters. Definitely a fun new show, and with music by
      <div class="emphasis">(K)now_Name</div>
      (who also did the amazing tracks for Dorohedoro), I can't wait to see
      where it goes next.
    </div>
    <div class="section">And that's it for TV. Last list is food!</div>

    <div class="section-header">Food</div>

    <div class="section">
      Speed round! With a kid on the way in 2022, we moved to have a little more
      space after 3.5 years in San Mateo, CA. In honor of the town's amazing
      food scene, here's a quick list of our top 10 places to grab a bite.
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      To leave room for the amazing places unique to San Mateo, I've left out
      larger chains like Bonchon, Teaspoon, Mochinut, Curry Up Now, and more
      amazing spots that are more broadly available. Also special shout out to
      Suruki Supermarket, which could steal the #1 spot, but I'll keep this list
      to restaurants.
