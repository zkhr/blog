Early on in the pandemic, I left my job at Verily which was hitting some
[growing pains](https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/30/21309306/alphabet-verily-suspended-employee-bonuses-diversity-initiatives-project-baseline)
while at the same time expecting everyone to work long hours on its new
[covid testing program](https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-16-alphabet-healthcare-verily-coronavirus-screening.html).
At my new job, a coworker asked what I did for fun. Since my wife and I had been
doing a lot of jigsaw puzzles I mentioned, "Puzzles?" and they said something
like, "oh you mean like puzzle hunts?".

And with that, I was [nerd sniped](https://xkcd.com/356/)! The rest is history.

# What is a puzzle hunt?

A puzzle hunt is a collection of puzzles, often with certain shared
characteristics like metapuzzles (that require the answers to previous puzzles
to solve) and answers that are short phrases or words.

Brian Chen's
[Introduction to Puzzlehunts](https://blog.vero.site/post/puzzlehunts) provides
an excellent background.

# Which hunts have I participated in?

I've done several hunts so far with my wife and friends, typically under the
**caffiends** alias. I would consider myself to be squarely in the "novice"
category. I can do the intro puzzles and maybe get a meta, but I still have a
ways to go.
