          Technological advance is an inherently iterative process. One does not
          simply take sand from the beach and produce a Dataprobe. We use crude
          tools to fashion better tools, and then our better tools to fashion
          more precise tools, and so on. Each minor refinement is a step in the
          process, and all of the steps must be taken.

      Everything on this site is hand-written in vim by sshing into (and
      attaching to a tmux session on) a linode (named <b>santiago</b>) from my
      laptop (more recently an M3 Pro named <b>acen</b>, but previously a 10+
      year old asus zenbook with long-standing keyboard and not-wanting-to-boot
      issues). That server hosts this site and some of my other assorted

      This blog does not and will not use AI or LLMs to generate any of its

      Jeph Jacques made a comment on
      <a href="https://questionablecontent.net/view.php?comic=5458">QC #5458</a>
      that he could just go back and fix old comics, but it took him ~20 years
      to realize that.

      I had this similar idea in my head that the content of these journal
      entries needed to be static snapshots and any changes needed dated caveats
      (like in
      <span class="link" data-x="1" data-y="-6">birds</span>), but at the end of
      the day, this is my blog so I can fix mistakes (like "sweet spot" to "soft
