      A few days ago, <a href="https://ooh.directory">ooh.directory</a> showed
      up on
      <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33719983">Hacker News</a>
      with collections of blogs on all sorts of topics. This reminded me how fun
      the internet was in the early 2000s and provided me the encouragement I
      needed to start a blog of my own. I'm not sure entirely what content will
      show up here, but probably a mix of old and new side projects, being a new
      father, games I'm playing, and other similar sorts of things.
