    A few days ago, <a href="https://ooh.directory">ooh.directory</a> showed up
    on
    <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33719983">Hacker News</a>
    with collections of blogs on all sorts of topics. This reminded me how fun
    the internet was in the early 2000s and provided me the encouragement I
    needed to start a blog of my own. I'm not sure entirely what content will
    show up here, but probably a mix of old and new side projects, being a new
    father, games I'm playing, and other similar sorts of things.
