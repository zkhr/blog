A few days ago, [ooh.directory](https://ooh.directory) showed up on
[Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33719983) with collections of
blogs on all sorts of topics. This reminded me how fun the internet was in the
early 2000s and provided me the encouragement I needed to start a blog of my
own. I'm not sure entirely what content will show up here, but probably a mix of
old and new side projects, being a new father, games I'm playing, and other
similar sorts of things.

If you're reading this and want to talk more about anything I've written, feel
free to reach out at _`blog@ariblumenthal.com`_.
