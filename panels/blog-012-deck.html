      With a nearly 3 month old at home, portable pausable gaming has allowed me
      to relax during my downtime when the little guy naps or feeds, but still
      lets me jump in on a moment's notice. After a couple of months doing this
      on the switch (with games like
      <span class="link" data-x="2" data-y="-2">pokemon scarlet</span>
      and <span class="link" data-x="3" data-y="-4">monster sanctuary</span>) or
      on my phone with
      <span class="link" data-x="2" data-y="-3">board game arena</span>, I
      decided to unlock my steam library and pick up a deck.

      And I enjoy using it immensely! The biggest technical issue I've
      encountered involves the screen not turning back on after sleeping, but
      with its short boot times, that issue hasn't bothered me too much.

      So far, I've played a few games on it. I tried out Desk Job, replayed some
      Hades and Cozy Grove, delved into the newer acclaimed Vampire Survivors,
      and took my Civ VI turns in my play by cloud games with friends.

      I even got ff14 working on it to catch up on the 6.3 main story! While
      reluctant to move from M+KB to controller gaming for an MMO, I've picked
      it up quicker than I thought I would, and actually prefer it for a few
      things already. Maybe not for extreme trials, but I'm mostly doing solo
      content anyway right now (so I can pause whenever I need to).

      Not sure what I'll play next, but studios have packed February with new
      games up my alley. Hogwarts Legacy comes out on Feb 10, Theatrhythm Final
      Bar Line on Feb 16, and Octopath Traveler 2 on Feb 24. And in the latest
      Friday Facts, Twinsen announced controller support for Factorio is
      <a href="https://www.factorio.com/blog/post/fff-372">on its way</a>, so
      I've got that to look forward to at some point, as well.
