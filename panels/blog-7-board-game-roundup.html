      The last few decades have seen a
      <span class="link" data-x="-2" data-y="0">board game</span>
      renaissance, with a tremendous number of amazing games coming out. Even
      better, they have made their way online where you can play against folks
      from around the world.

      When I was younger, there wasn't the same variety of board games we have
      today, especially in digital form. I remember learning a bunch of Risk
      strategy by playing
      <a href="https://github.com/brian-scott-andrews/TurboRisk">TurboRisk</a>
      bots and then using that later to work my way up through the ranks of
      <a href="https://www.conquerclub.com/">conquerclub.com</a>.

      Now, with sites like
      <a href="https://boardgamearena.com/">board game arena</a>, there are all
      sorts of games available to play! I'm currently playing seven different
      games at seven virtual tables.

    <div class="section">
      In the order of when the games were released, here they are:
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      2004 - <b>EKONOS.</b> A simple game with three parts: (A) a stock market
      where you can buy and sell shares in stocks, (B) a Risk-style map where
      you can expand and take over other companies, and (C) a deck of cards that
      determines which companies you can expand each round.
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      2010 - <b>7 Wonders</b>. A card drafting game where you build up your
      civilization. While taking simultaneous turns to draft (great for online
      games), you get points based on your military, science, and more. Cards
      can only be drafted if you have the right resources or have drafted
      prerequisite cards.
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      2013 - <b>Sushi Go!</b> Sushi Go! is a simpler drafting game with a
      similar playstyle. Instead of building a civilization (and needing to buy
      drafted cards), you instead earn points based on the types and
      combinations of sushi you draft.
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      2015 - <b>Letter Tycoon.</b> What if you could buy patents for the letters
      of the alphabet? In this game, you draw letters from a deck of cards to
      make words and get bonuses based on the letter patents that you've bought.
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      2016 - <b>Kingdomino.</b> This is a game of drafting dominoes to build up
      a 5x5 grid. Points are earned based on contiguous types of land (lakes,
      forests, etc) and the number of crowns contained on those tiles.
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      2017 - <b>Azul.</b> This is a game of drafting patterned ceramic tiles and
      using them to build a wall, scoring points based on matching colors and
      building rows/columns.
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      2019 - <b>Wingspan.</b> Tableau building game with birds. Probably my
      favorite new board game of 2022.
