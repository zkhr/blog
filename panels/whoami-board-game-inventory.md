As mentioned in my
<a class="link" data-x="2" data-y="-3">board game roundup</a> blog post, I love
the variety of games out there these days. This page is an inventory of the ones
in my closet right now.

If you think there are games I might like based on what I tend to play, send me
a message with your recommendations!
