As mentioned in my
<span class="link" data-x="2" data-y="-3">board game roundup</span> blog post, I
love the variety of games out there these days. This page is an inventory of the
ones in my closet right now.

If you think there are games I might like based on what I tend to play, send me
a message with your recommendations!
