      I started to play around with the
      <a href="https://godotengine.org">Godot</a> game engine a few days ago,
      since I have some ideas for games I'd like to make. Whether or not any of
      them come to fruition is still tbd, but I decided to give it a go to see
      what comes of it.
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      I searched a little bit about each of the major engines these days (godot,
      unity, unreal, etc) and for the sort of 2D games I'd be working on (and
      the positive feedback from developers that use it), Godot 4.2 with
      GDScript seemed like a pretty good fit to try out.

    <div class="section">
      To learn the basics, I did the intro "dodge the creeps" game in their docs
      and then tasked myself with implementing solitaire. Not trivial, but not
      super complex either.

      This isn't my first foray into game development. Twice before I've made a
      few simple games.

    <div class="section">
      As a kid, I learned Visual Basic and used that for assorted projects. One
      was a game where a box would jump around the screen and you had to click
      it to progress.
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      Later in high school, I took an intro class that I vaguely recall had me
      make some game in Java to learn OOP, but I can't recall offhand anymore
      what it entailed.

    <div class="section-header">III</div>

    <div class="section">So I got the solitaire game working.</div>

    <div class="section">
      And then I remembered, I don't really like solitaire.

    <div class="section">
      Most of the programming was pretty straightforward and provided a good
      opportunity to learn the Godot UI, GDScript syntax and all that.
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      There was an interesting issue I ran into around handling a click event
      that overlapped with multiple
      <span class="inline-code">Area2D</span> nodes (e.g. when dragging a card
      that was on top of another draggable card). I originally used the input
      event signals, but I had no way of figuring out which one should handle
      the event (no deterministic order I could figure out as to which node
      triggered first or to prevent propagation).
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      I eventually stumbled upon the
      <a
        href="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_physicsdirectspacestate2d.html#class-physicsdirectspacestate2d-method-intersect-point"
        >intersect_point</a
      >
      function I could use to get a list of everything that overlapped with the
      click and filter that by z-index to get the node I wanted.
