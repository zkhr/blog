    <div class="section">
      When I set out on creating this new blog, I knew I wanted it to have a
      novel aspect. While the high level content is pretty familiar across
      personal websites on the web (about me, blog, projects, etc), the
      structure puts a fun spin on the "single page application" concept.
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      As you may have seen by the time you got to this blog post,
      <b>the site is an infinite grid.</b> Each page on this site is a panel in
      that grid.
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      The prototype for this is relatively straightforward, but it required a
      couple interesting pieces across my
      <a href="https://www.nginx.com/">nginx</a> config, CSS, and JS.
    </div>

    <div class="section-header">nginx config</div>

    <div class="section">
      For the prototype implementation, I load the entire website, no matter
      which page you hit. This allows exploring without having to load anything
      additional from the server. Since this site is all text, it loads quickly
      (and will for the foreseeable future).
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      To support this in my nginx configuration, I do two important things:
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      1. I enable
      <a href="http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_ssi_module.html"
        >Server Side Includes</a
      >
      with <span class="inline-code">ssi on</span>. This allows me to create a
      new file per panel and then include them individually in the main
      index.html.
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      2. I use the
      <a
        href="http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_rewrite_module.html#rewrite"
        >rewrite</a
      >
      directive so that all paths that start with
      <span class="inline-code">/!</span>
      will get sent to that index.html file.
    </div>

    <pre class="code-block">
location /! {
  rewrite ^.*$ /;
}
</pre
    >

    <div class="section">
      This allows me to track the current position of the user in the grid in
      the URL. For example, this page's path starts with
      <span class="inline-code">/!/1/-3</span>, which defines the x and y
      coordinates of 1 and -3 respectively. When the user refreshes the page, we
      correctly load the index.html file (instead of throwing a 404 not found
      error).
    </div>

    <div class="section-header">CSS</div>

    <div class="section">
      The grid is a <span class="inline-code">position: relative</span> element
      that holds all of the panels. To move from panel to panel, we change the
      grid's left and top properties.
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      As an analogy, you can think of your monitor as a microscope and the grid
      as a slide under the lens. To move around, we move around the slide, while
      the scope remains stationary.
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      Within the grid are several
      <span class="inline-code">position: absolute</span> panels. Each panel has
      distinct x and y coordinates, which are used to set appropriate left and
      top properties when initializing the page. Because of the relative
      position attribute on the grid, these are absolute positions relative to
      the grid.
    </div>

    <div class="section-header">JS</div>

    <div class="section">
      For the prototype, the JS code does three main things:
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      1. Placement of the grid panels at their appropriate locations in the
      grid.
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      2. Enabling the grid links so that we can easily navigate between panels.
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      3. Supporting keyboard navigation (asdf, hjkl, arrow keys) as well as
      touchscreen navigation as alternative mechanisms to move between panels.
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      And that's pretty much it. As mentioned, I load the whole site on every
      page load which isn't ideal. If I stick at this blogging thing for a
      while, I will probably write a small server to better handle loading
      panels as needed.
    </div>
