Learning about typography can lead you to noticing things that you might have
otherwise missed before. This can suck, like seeing
<a href="https://xkcd.com/1015/">b<span class="bad-kerning">ad
ke</span>rning</a > everywhere, but it can also be fun to see the patterns in
fonts used by restaurants, websites, movies, and more.

I'm not an expert on this topic, but I love seeing new and interesting fonts and
wish more sites on the internet took advantage of the variety out there. So to
that end, I've gone ahead and updated this site to use a few that I like.

Most text content is written using a font based on
[Edsger W. Dijkstra's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsger_W._Dijkstra)
handwriting that I grabbed from
[Luca Cardelli](http://lucacardelli.name/indexArtifacts.html).

For titles, section headers, and links around the blog, I use
[Carl Krull's](https://carlkrull.dk/) Traveling Typewriter font.

For code, I use Ubuntu Mono, which is my favorite monospace font and the one
I've used for
[my terminal](https://github.com/zkhr/config/blob/master/dotfiles/.Xresources)
for many years (even though Ubuntu is no longer my linux distro of choice).
Canonical funded [Dalton Maag](https://www.daltonmaag.com/) to create this font
family for the Maverick Meerkat release in 2010.

  I've updated the fonts since this was originally written. Check out the
