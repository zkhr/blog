# Urza and the Kor

My foray into magic began with the **Call of the Kor** deck from Stronghold
(1998).

However, when I think of my personal magic nostalgia, the picture in my head is
of the [Lightning Dragon] on the cover of those Urza's Saga tournament packs.

Of the cards I own from this generation, some of my favorites were [Memory Jar],
[Rancor], and [Deranged Hermit] from Urza's Legacy (1999).

# On again, off again

Magic as a hobby came and went. There were sets I drafted with my friends again
and again like Mirrodin (2003), Champions of Kamigawa (2004), and Ravnica: City
of Guilds (2005).

And sets I missed entirely.

While I mostly drafted, I do remember buying singles to get a set of
[Wellwisher] and [Llanowar Elves] to build an elf deck around
[Voice of the Woods] from Onslaught (2002).

Of the cards I own from this generation, some of my favorites were
[Isamaru, Hound of Konda] from Kamigawa, [Skyknight Legionnaire] from Ravnica,
and [Sarkhan Vol] from Shards of Alara (2008).

# Duels

I briefly played Magic Duels in 2015, but gave up fairly quickly.

I posted on reddit about an
[issue with deck size limits](https://www.reddit.com/r/magicduels/comments/3flm74/bug_circumvent_deck_card_limits/)
(but never heard from the devs for that bug report).

# Arena

I played a bit of arena a few years ago. There were two decks I built that I
remember really enjoying.

The first was a [Brushfire Elemental] deck (Zendikar Rising, 2020) that used
those landfall creatures to try and win the game quickly (and a few
[Goldspan Dragons] (Kaldheim, 2021) to finish the job.

The other was an [Archon of Sun's Grace] deck (Theros Beyond Death, 2020) that
used enchantments to make a bunch of pegasuses (pegasi?).

# Intrigue and Critters

This year, I've found myself playing paper magic again, first with the
preconstructed Murders at Karlov Manor commander decks and then drafting
Bloomburrow and Foundations.

I absolutely love that full art lands have made a strong resurgence in recent
sets. So many cool options, from the Phyrexia: All Will Be One
[lands](https://scryfall.com/search?q=%28type%3Aland+type%3Abasic%29+is%3Afullart+unique%3Aprints+set%3Aone+language%3Aph&unique=cards&as=grid&order=name)
in the Phyrexian language and the unique art style of the Kamigawa: Neon Dynasty
[lands](https://scryfall.com/search?q=%28type%3Aland+type%3Abasic%29+is%3Afullart+unique%3Aprints+set%3Aneo&unique=cards&as=grid&order=name)
to the stained glass Dominaria United
[lands](https://scryfall.com/search?q=%28type%3Aland+type%3Abasic%29+is%3Afullart+unique%3Aprints+set%3Admu&unique=cards&as=grid&order=name),
the stellar Theros Beyond Death
[lands](https://scryfall.com/search?q=%28type%3Aland+type%3Abasic%29+is%3Afullart+unique%3Aprints+set%3Athb&unique=cards&as=grid&order=name),
and the negative space Outlaws of Thunder Junction
[lands](https://scryfall.com/search?q=%28type%3Aland+type%3Abasic%29+is%3Afullart+unique%3Aprints+set%3Aotj&unique=cards&as=grid&order=name).

Of this generation, I've in general enjoyed the art and theme of Bloomburrow,
but my runaway favorite card is the [Mabel, Heir to Cragflame] I drafted.

# Final Fantasy x Magic

Another on again, off again game I've played over the years are the various
iterations of Final Fantasy (e.g. see me previously trying to replay FFXV in the
<span class="link" data-x="3" data-y="-5">2022 epilogue</span> before my son was
born (spoiler, he got here 2 weeks early) and
<span class="link" data-x="2" data-y="-9">looking forward</span> to Dawntrail
earlier this year (spoiler, it was great)).

So it's no wonder I'm excited for the upcoming
[collaboration](https://magic.wizards.com/en/products/final-fantasy) between
these two franchises next year. I can't wait to build a chocobo or moogle deck.
