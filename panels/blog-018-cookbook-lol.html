      I put together a minimal website over at
      <a href="https://cookbook.lol">cookbook.lol</a> to start storing my
      recipes. This is the start of the cookbookbook idea from
      <span class="link" data-x="0" data-y="-6">project ideas i.</span>

    <div class="section">It does a couple cool things:</div>

    <div class="section">
      <ul>
        <li>
          You can track when recipes are variations of other recipes (either on
          the site or from a blog or cookbook)
        </li>
        <li>It has some basic organization (tracking saved/tried recipes)</li>
        <li>It has support for basic comment threads.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      It is definitely missing a lot of features and thereâ€™s tons more I want to
      do here, but the core functionality is there.

    <div class="section">
      There is an existing nginx instance running for this blog which routes
      traffic to new local frontend and backend servers. In the future, we can
      split one or both of these out into their own instances.
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      The frontend serves all requests to
      <a href="https://cookbook.lol">cookbook.lol</a>. These requests are served
      by a nodejs server that renders a bunch of closure (aka soy) templates.
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      The backend server is a minimal (mostly aip.dev style resource-oriented)
      API implemented in nodejs with postgresql for storage.
