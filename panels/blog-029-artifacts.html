          Superior training and superior weaponry have, when taken together, a
          geometric effect on overall military strength. Well-trained,
          well-equipped troops can stand up to many more times their lesser
          brethren than linear arithmetic would seem to indicate.

      After playing
      <span class="link" data-x="3" data-y="-8">spacetraders</span> a few months
      ago, I've once again found myself playing an API game. In
      <a href="https://artifactsmmo.com/">Artifacts</a>, you're automating
      characters in an mmorpg.
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      Last time around I wrote everything in JS to go fast, but wished I'd tried
      out something new. This time around, I went with
      <div class="emphasis">Rust.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      I haven't used any languages with memory management since C/C++ at
      <span class="link" data-x="3" data-y="-9">university</span>, so actually
      thinking about the stack and heap and reference counting and all that was
      an interesting change of pace.
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      For some definition of interesting. Was that a
      <span class="inline-code">&amp;str</span>
      or a <span class="inline-code">String</span> that I wanted?

      <div class="section-header">Read the book.</div>

      <div class="section">
        I don't remember what blog I found it on, but a few days into using
        Rust, I read a comment like "you can't just jump into using Rust, you
        have to read <i>the book</i>". Whoops, I guess.
      </div>

      <div class="section-header">Personas.</div>

      <div class="section">
        My implementation for artifacts is pretty similar to what I'd done for
        spacetraders with personas I could attach to my characters, but just a
        different set of tasks. Usually characters stuck to a specific persona,
        but sometimes I would have them all do the same one overnight (e.g. to
        get a bunch of resources or level up). The ones I ended up settling on
        were:
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        The
        <div class="emphasis">Crafter</div>
        persona to make weapons, gear, or jewelry.
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        The
        <div class="emphasis">Gatherer</div>
        persona to chop wood and mine ore.
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        The
        <div class="emphasis">Fighter</div>
        persona for characters to farm individual monsters or tasks coins.
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        The
        <div class="emphasis">Angler</div>
        persona to fish and cook.
      </div>

      At one point I also had a
      <div class="emphasis">Chicken Chaser</div>
      that just battled chickens.

      <div class="section-header">Rust positives.</div>

      <div class="section">
        As a fan of <span class="inline-code">Optional</span> introduced
        recently in Java 8 (okay so I guess 2014 isn't considered recent
        anymore, but at least that isn't as old as that chicken chaser reference
        (Fable came out in 2004) and I did have a coworker whose license plate
        was JAVA 8, but that's unrelated) as a way of making code more explicit
        and readable, Rust's <span class="inline-code">Option</span> is pretty
        handy as well. <span class="inline-code">Result</span> is handy for
        similar reasons.
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        Spinning up and coordinating multiple threads was super painless. If
        something went wrong with one of them during the night, the other
        characters could still do their thing.
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <span class="inline-code">loop {}</span> is rad.
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        Grabbing code from other crates was relatively straightforward. I used
        chrono (for dealing with time stuff), reqwest (for making the API
        calls), and serde (for handling json).
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        Error messages during compilation are excellent. No notes. For someone
        totally new to the language, they provided great starting points for
        learning more.

      <div class="section-header">Skies.</div>

      <div class="section">
        My five characters are named after protagonists from Skies of Arcadia,
        the best RPG ever made (when wearing my particular set of nostalgia
        goggles): Vyse, Aika, Fina, Enrique, and Drachma.
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        It is surprising that in ~2 years of doing this blog I haven't written
        anything about that game yet. Guess I have to replay it in 2025.
