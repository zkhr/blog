    <div class="section">
      The last year or so has been great for the pokémon franchise with several
      games hitting that nostalgic itch and innovating in interesting
      directions.

      revisited the best N64 rails shooter and in Jan 2022,

      continue this with another solid entry in the franchise. While many
      reviews rightfully criticize the performance and graphical issues, having
      grown up with the graphics of n64 and gamecube games, that didn't really
      bother me too much. Instead, I could enjoy a really engaging gameplay loop
      of just wandering around an open world, catching pokémon, and taking down
      gyms.

      This time around, I tried to have a balance of pokémon from different
      generations with good type coverage. Here is the lineup:

      I started with the fire croc Fuecoco, so its evolution Skeledirge was the
      first pick. Running into Pawmi early on meant that of course Pawmmot would
      take spot #2. I have a sweet spot for any mon that can learn
      <a href="https://www.serebii.net/attackdex-sv/falseswipe.shtml"
        >false swipe</a
      >, so Scizor, Drednaw, and Garchomp all made the cut. Finally, to round
      out the team with some fairy and psychic coverage, Gardevoir took spot #6.
