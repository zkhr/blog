      The fifth ffxiv expansion, <span class="emphasis">Dawntrail</span>,
      <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/dawntrail"
        >releases in exactly three weeks</a
      >
      on June 28 and I'm excited to continue the adventure. It will be
      interesting to see how the dynamics between the Scions plays out on
      opposite sides of the political struggle over in Tural and Wuk Lamat seems
      like a great addition to the cast.

    <div class="section">
      If there isn't a battle on that big bridge between the northern and
      southern regions, I will be sorely disappointed.

    <div class="section">
      I have one book left in
      <span class="emphasis">The Murderbot Diaries</span>
      series by Martha Wells after which I'll be caught up (until the
      <a
        href="https://reactormag.com/tordotcom-publishing-acquires-six-martha-wells-books-including-three-murderbot-diaries/"
        >next three</a
      >
      come out). The titular character's relatable perspective on this dystopian
      universe has been entertaining to read, what with Murderbot's growth as a
      person, their relationships with ART, Ratthi, Mensah and the rest of their
      crew, and all the various adventures, missions, and whodunits.
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      It also looks like there will be a TV adaption of the books expected to
      release later this year, about which I'm fairly optimistic. Although with
      Murderbot processing so many things in parallel, it will be interesting to
      see how it translates to this medium.

    <div class="section">
      I tried out the Ultracube mod a few weeks ago, but the weekly friday facts
      for <span class="emphasis">Factorio</span> really have me excitedly
      waiting for the next expansion that might be releasing later this year.
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      The
      <a href="https://www.factorio.com/blog/post/fff-414">fff-414</a> details
      earlier today about resources spoiling on Gleba have me cautiously
      optimistic, since it's a mechanic that penalizes my habit of frequently
      buffering materials on my bases.

    <div class="section">
      The music in
      <a href="https://www.factorio.com/blog/post/fff-406">fff-406</a> is
      amazing. A lot of my spotify history is whatever game soundtrack I'm
      listening to in the background while coding (FFXIV, Frostpunk, Octopath
      Traveler, etc) and this looks to be a strong addition. (The rest of my
      history is my kid's playlists.)
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      I have such a huge amount of respect for the factorio devs. It is obvious
      how much love and polish they put into the game and I can't imagine this
      expansion will be any exception.

    <div class="section">
      After writing the first three sections of this journal entry, I looked up
      out of curiosity if there had been any news on when
      <span class="emphasis">Civ 7</span> was coming out, and lo and behold, it
      was
      <a
        href="https://forums.civfanatics.com/threads/civilization-7-has-been-revealed.690063/"
        >accidentally announced</a
      >
      earlier today! (It has since been formally announced for 2025.)

    <div class="section">
      With previous Civ games releasing in 1991 (I), 1996 (II), 2001 (III), 2005
      (IV), 2010 (V), 2016 (VI), this 9 year gap will have been the longest
      between major releases.

      Last year I launched
      <span class="link" data-x="2" data-y="-5">roze</span>, a discord bot for
      tracking turns for multiplayer Civ 6 games. She is now a verified bot in
      over 100 servers, which is pretty exciting (and required me to do some
      extra data retention cleanups and introduce a terms of service). If they
      don't include built-in support for something similar in Civ 7, I'll try
      and get roze up and running pretty quickly after launch.
