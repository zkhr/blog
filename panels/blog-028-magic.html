    <div class="section-header">Urza and the Kor</div>

    <div class="section">
      My foray into magic began with the
      <div class="emphasis">Call of the Kor</div>
      deck from Stronghold (1998).
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      However, when I think of my personal magic nostalgia, the picture in my
      head is of the
      <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/usg/202/lightning-dragon"
        >Lightning Dragon</a
      >
      on the cover of those Urza's Saga tournament packs.
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      Of the cards I own from this generation, some of my favorites were
      <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/ulg/129/memory-jar">Memory Jar</a>,
      <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/ulg/110/rancor">Rancor</a>, and
      <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/ulg/101/deranged-hermit"
        >Deranged Hermit</a
      >
      from Urza's Legacy (1999).

    <div class="section-header">On again, off again</div>

    <div class="section">
      Magic as a hobby came and went. There were sets I drafted with my friends
      again and again like Mirrodin (2003), Champions of Kamigawa (2004), and
      Ravnica: City of Guilds (2005).
    </div>

    <div class="section">And sets I missed entirely.</div>

    <div class="section">
      While I mostly drafted, I do remember buying singles to get a set of
      <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/ons/300/wellwisher">Wellwisher</a> and
      <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/4ed/261/llanowar-elves"
        >Llanowar Elves</a
      >
      to build an elf deck around
      <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/ons/297/voice-of-the-woods"
        >Voice of the Woods</a
      >
      from Onslaught (2002).
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      Of the cards I own from this generation, some of my favorites were
      <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/chk/19/isamaru-hound-of-konda"
        >Isamaru, Hound of Konda</a
      >
      from Kamigawa,
      <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/rav/232/skyknight-legionnaire"
        >Skyknight Legionnaire</a
      >
      from Ravnica, and
      <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/ala/191/sarkhan-vol">Sarkhan Vol</a>
      from Shards of Alara (2008).

    <div class="section-header">Duels</div>

    <div class="section">
      I briefly played Magic Duels in 2015, but gave up fairly quickly.
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      I posted on reddit about an
      <a
        href="https://www.reddit.com/r/magicduels/comments/3flm74/bug_circumvent_deck_card_limits/"
        >issue with deck size limits</a
      >
      (but never heard from the devs for that bug report).
    </div>

    <div class="section-header">Arena</div>

    <div class="section">
      I played a bit of arena a few years ago. There were two decks I built that
      I remember really enjoying.
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      The first was a
      <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/znr/221/brushfire-elemental"
        >Brushfire Elemental</a
      >
      deck (Zendikar Rising, 2020) that used those landfall creatures to try and
      win the game quickly (and a few
      <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/khm/139/goldspan-dragon"
        >Goldspan Dragons</a
      >
      (Kaldheim, 2021) to finish the job.
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      The other was an
      <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/thb/3/archon-of-suns-grace"
        >Archon of Sun's Grace</a
      >
      deck (Theros Beyond Death, 2020) that used enchantments to make a bunch of
      pegasuses (pegasi?).
    </div>

    <div class="section-header">Intrigue and Critters</div>

    <div class="section">
      This year, I've found myself playing paper magic again, first with the
      preconstructed Murders at Karlov Manor commander decks and then drafting
      Bloomburrow and Foundations.
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      I absolutely love that full art lands have made a strong resurgence in
      recent sets. So many cool options, from the Phyrexia: All Will Be One

        >lands</a
      >.
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      Of this generation, I've in general enjoyed the art and theme of
      Bloomburrow, but my runaway favorite card is the
      <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/blb/224/mabel-heir-to-cragflame"
        >Mabel, Heir to Cragflame</a
      >
      I drafted.

    <div class="section-header">Final Fantasy x Magic</div>

    <div class="section">
      Another on again, off again game I've played over the years are the
      various iterations of Final Fantasy (e.g. see me previously trying to
      replay FFXV in the
      <span class="link" data-x="3" data-y="-5">2022 epilogue</span> before my
      son was born (spoiler, he got here 2 weeks early) and
      <span class="link" data-x="2" data-y="-9">looking forward</span> to
      Dawntrail earlier this year (spoiler, it was great)).
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      So it's no wonder I'm excited for the upcoming
      <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/products/final-fantasy"
        >collaboration</a
      >
      between these two franchises next year. I can't wait to build a chocobo or
      moogle deck.
