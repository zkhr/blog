      After updating the dictionary used by my
      <span class="link" data-x="0" data-y="-3">booggle</span> app, I noticed
      several words had been removed. One of them was
      <span class="emphasis">rhinoceroi</span>.

    <div class="section-header">what is a dictionary?</div>

    <div class="section">
      The Oxford English Dictionary (OED) defines a dictionary as
      <div class="quote">
        A book which explains or translates, usually in alphabetical order, the
        words of a language or languages (or of a particular category of
        vocabulary), giving for each word its typical spelling, an explanation
        of its meaning or meanings, and often other information, such as
        pronunciation, etymology, synonyms, equivalents in other languages, and
        illustrative examples. Also (from the late 20th cent.): an electronic
        resource performing this function.
      </div>
      But languages evolve and the words and meanings change. So who decides
      what a dictionary includes at any given point in time?

      In a tournament setting, you'll probably use either the NASPA Word List
      (NWL) or Collins Scrabble Words (CSW) depending on what country you live
      in.

    <div class="section-header">rhinoceroi?</div>

    <div class="section">
      Yeah, so I recently updated from NWL2020 (the second edition) to NWL2023
      (the third edition) for my app. That change got rid of several words,
      including rhinoceroi.

      If you go to dictionary.com, rhinoceroi happily gives you a "No results

      In June 2006, the user Doremítzwr added the rhinoceroi definition as an
      "Etymologically correct plural of rhinoceros".

    <div class="section">
      By July another user had marked it as
      <span class="emphasis">hypercorrect</span>. This was to inform readers
      that while this was an attempt to follow the rules of language and be more
      <i>correct</i>, the word is instead usually considered incorrect.
