      After beating the main story in
      <span class="link" data-x="2" data-y="-2">pok√©mon scarlet</span> a few
      weeks ago, I decided to keep the creature catching going with

      This game is a cross between a typical monster taming adventure and a
      side-scrolling metroidvania. Combat in the game is in the form of 3v3
      turn-based monster battles with your typical elemental resistances, buffs,
      debuffs, etc, but there is enough variance between the different monsters
      and some interesting combat mechanics which keep things interesting and
      engaging.

      For my first playthrough, I started with the <b>#4 Spectral Lion</b> and
      ended up keeping my same team of early monsters throughout:
      <b>#12 Monk</b>, <b>#20 G'rulu</b>, <b>#34 Ice Blob</b>,
      <b>#51 Tanuki</b> and <b>#61 Manticorb</b>. That said, all the other
      monsters I caught for their abilities and to fill out the journal seemed
      pretty viable and had interesting skill combinations of their own.

      I think this is one of the games where you kind of know ahead of time if
      you'll like it or not. If a monster catching side-scrolling metroidvania
      sounds fun to you, give it a whirl. The combat mechanics are a lot of fun
      and it won't disappoint.
