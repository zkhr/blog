      There are two kinds of scientific progress: the methodical
      experimentation and categorization which gradually extend the
      boundaries of knowledge, and the revolutionary leap of genius which
      redefines and transcends those boundaries. Acknowledging our debt to
      the former, we yearn nonetheless for the latter.

# Prelude

While digging through some files, I found my college transcript from — _looks at
calendar_ — 13 years ago and thought it might be fun to jot down some
recollections.

# Transfer

<div class="book">
  General Chemistry I <span class="tag chem">CHEM 102</span>
</div>
<div class="book">
  General Chemistry II <span class="tag chem">CHEM 104</span>
</div>
<div class="book">Calculus <span class="tag math">MATH 220</span></div>
<div class="book">Calculus II <span class="tag math">MATH 231</span></div>

I took a few AP tests in high school and got out of intro chemistry and calculus
freshman year. It's still interesting that after a decade or so of school before
university, a handful of transfer credits from AP tests are the only things that
carry over.

<div class="book">

</div>

I actually started off as a mechanical engineering major, hence taking
<span class="tag mech">ME 170</span>. It was cool to play around with CAD for a
semester, but ultimately not what I wanted to do.

My AP physics score wasn't high enough and I didn't pass the exam to get credit
for multivariable calculus, so even though I took both
<span class="tag phys">PHYS 211</span> and
<span class="tag math">MATH 241</span> in high school, I had to take them again
freshman year.

# Spring 08

<div class="book">
  Intro to Computer Science <span class="tag cs">CS 125</span>
</div>
<div class="book">

</div>
<div class="book">

</div>

After quickly deciding to switch to a CS major, I had to take
<span class="tag cs">CS 125</span> and
<span class="tag cs">CS 173</span> before the program would let me officially
transfer in. Which is so much easier than today, since you're apparently no
longer allowed to move into the CS program from within the university.

# Fall 08

<div class="book">Data Structures <span class="tag cs">CS 225</span></div>
<div class="book">

</div>
<div class="book">
  Statistics and Probability I <span class="tag math">MATH 463</span>
</div>

Learning data structures in <span class="tag cs">CS 225</span> was one of the
top two most important software dev classes I took. Useful for day to day coding
fundamentals (and passing interviews).

<span class="tag cs">CS 460</span> was pretty neat, we read articles like
<a href="http://phrack.org/issues/49/14.html#article">Smashing The Stack For Fun
And Profit</a> and then implemented them in the computer lab.

I remember putting
[a certain penny arcade comic](https://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2004/03/19/green-blackboards-and-other-anomalies)
in a presentation for my <span class="tag cs">CS 210</span> ethics class. Got a
good score on it, but the teacher wasn't fond of the cursing.

Hands down, my favorite class at university was
<span class="tag cs">CS 242</span>. This class had a weekly programming
assignment that you could solve in any number of ways, but you would have to
present your solution to a small group of other students and a TA. This meant
you saw the different ways that everyone in your group approached the same
problem.

Some weeks, the assignment would build up off of the previous week's work
(without you knowing ahead of time), so if you wrote clean code, you'd be better
off than if you quickly hacked something together and left yourself with a bunch
of techdebt.

Probably the closest class in college to actually having a software job.

<div class="book">Database Systems <span class="tag cs">CS 411</span></div>

<div class="book">

</div>
<div class="book">Intro Psych <span class="tag other">PSYC 100</span></div>

Along with data structures, <span class="tag cs">CS 473</span> is the other of
the top two most important software dev classes. I still recommend Erickson's
[algorithms textbook](http://jeffe.cs.illinois.edu/teaching/algorithms/) as a
canonical reference for learning or reviewing this topic.

When a student asked if dancing would be on the final exam, the answer was yes!
We got a
[final](http://jeffe.cs.illinois.edu/teaching/algorithms/hwex/s10/final.pdf)
where every question was about dancing.

<div class="book">

During my last year of college, I had to finish up some gen eds and decided to
start taking some extra math classes like
<span class="tag math">MATH 417</span> for fun.

<span class="tag cs">CS 598</span> with
<a href="https://lavalle.pl">LaValle</a> was a super interesting dive into
relevant research papers (and the only grad-level course I've taken).

# Spring 11

<div class="book">
  Introduction to Bioinformatics <span class="tag cs">CS 466</span>

</div>
<div class="book">

</div>

My senior thesis for <span class="tag cs">CS 499</span> was
[A primer on covering spaces for robot exploration](/misc/thesis.pdf), which was
essentially a variation of the
[art gallery problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_gallery_problem).
