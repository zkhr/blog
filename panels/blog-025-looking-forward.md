# I

The fifth ffxiv expansion, **Dawntrail**,
[releases in exactly three weeks](https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/dawntrail) on
June 28 and I'm excited to continue the adventure. It will be interesting to see
how the dynamics between the Scions plays out on opposite sides of the political
struggle over in Tural and Wuk Lamat seems like a great addition to the cast.

If there isn't a battle on that big bridge between the northern and southern
regions, I will be sorely disappointed.

# II

I have one book left in **The Murderbot Diaries** series by Martha Wells after
which I'll be caught up (until the
[next three](https://reactormag.com/tordotcom-publishing-acquires-six-martha-wells-books-including-three-murderbot-diaries/)
come out). The titular character's relatable perspective on this dystopian
universe has been entertaining to read, what with Murderbot's growth as a
person, their relationships with ART, Ratthi, Mensah and the rest of their crew,
and all the various adventures, missions, and whodunits.

It also looks like there will be a TV adaption of the books expected to release
later this year, about which I'm fairly optimistic. Although with Murderbot
processing so many things in parallel, it will be interesting to see how it
translates to this medium.

# III

I tried out the Ultracube mod a few weeks ago, but the weekly friday facts for
**Factorio** really have me excitedly waiting for the next expansion that might
be releasing later this year.

The [fff-414](https://www.factorio.com/blog/post/fff-414) details earlier today
about resources spoiling on Gleba have me cautiously optimistic, since it's a
mechanic that penalizes my habit of frequently buffering materials on my bases.

The music in [fff-406](https://www.factorio.com/blog/post/fff-406) is amazing. A
lot of my spotify history is whatever game soundtrack I'm listening to in the
background while coding (FFXIV, Frostpunk, Octopath Traveler, etc) and this
looks to be a strong addition. (The rest of my history is my kid's playlists.)

I have such a huge amount of respect for the factorio devs. It is obvious how
much love and polish they put into the game and I can't imagine this expansion
will be any exception.

# IV

After writing the first three sections of this journal entry, I looked up out of
curiosity if there had been any news on when **Civ 7** was coming out, and lo
and behold, it was
[accidentally announced](https://forums.civfanatics.com/threads/civilization-7-has-been-revealed.690063/)
earlier today! (It has since been formally announced for 2025.)

With previous Civ games releasing in 1991 (I), 1996 (II), 2001 (III), 2005 (IV),
2010 (V), 2016 (VI), this 9 year gap will have been the longest between major
releases.

Last year I launched
<span class="link" data-x="2" data-y="-5">roze</span>, a discord bot for
tracking turns for multiplayer Civ 6 games. She is now a verified bot in over
100 servers, which is pretty exciting (and required me to do some extra data
retention cleanups and introduce a terms of service). If they don't include
built-in support for something similar in Civ 7, I'll try and get roze up and
running pretty quickly after launch.
