    <div class="section">Some thoughts on daylight savings time.</div>

    <div class="section-header">I</div>

    <div class="section">
      A few weeks ago, my one year old and I dug through a storage bin in the
      basement and found my old lime green gameboy color, with batteries that
      were decades old and just a little juice left. Contained within, a
      cartridge of pokémon gold ready to play.
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      Starting a new game and listening to some 8-bit music, we pretty quickly
      got to the question: "Is it Daylight Saving Time now?"
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      I didn't know the answer back when I first loaded up the game as a kid and
      nearly 25 years later, honestly? I can still never remember which half of
      the year is DST.

    <div class="section">
      So fun new thing as a dad of a 1yo: this is the first year where spring
      forward was the good one.
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      Usually fall back gives the extra hour of sleep, but the clock isn’t the
      deciding factor of when I wake up anymore. My kid is. So spring forward
      gave me the extra hour of sleep.
    </div>

    <div class="section">More or less.</div>

    <div class="section-header">III</div>

    <div class="section">
      Consider pitching the concept of DST today if it didn't already exist.
      Everyone once a year decides to move the clock one hour forward, and then
      six months later, we reverse it and move the clock one hour back. It's
      unimaginable.
    </div>

    <div class="section">Nobody would agree to it. So how did we get here?</div>

    <div class="section">
      Well in the US, it started in March of 1918 with the
      <b>Standard Time Act</b> which followed similar changes in Europe during
      WWI. The library of congress has some fun

      available online from the time.

    <div class="section">
      In 2018,
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_California_Proposition_7"
        >Prop 7</a
      >
      passed when I was in California, showing a positive sentiment towards
      getting rid of this twice-a-year nonsense. But, that prop didn't actually
      implement the change, just the ability for a change to happen in the
      future.
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      So is there any hope of change? Right now, with the
      <b>Uniform Time Act</b> of 1966, states can decide to have permanent
      standard time (an hour back), but cannot have permanent DST (an hour
      forward). The only states with year-round standard time today are Hawaii
      and Arizona.
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      In 2022, the
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunshine_Protection_Act"
        >Sunshine Protection Act</a
      >
      proposed permanent DST at a federal level, but after passing in the
      Senate, it never made it to the House. Newer iterations of this bill have
      been suggested, but nothing has come of it yet. There is also the open
      question of whether year-round standard time or DST time is better, for
      some definition of better.

      I don't have a specific story I can think of offhand, but I agree with
      <a href="https://xkcd.com/2867/">xkcd/2867</a> so very much.

      Leap second bugs, timezone bugs, dst bugs, browser time vs server time, on
      and on.

    <div class="section">
      Any part of a software project dealing with datetimes makes me a little
      extra cautious.
