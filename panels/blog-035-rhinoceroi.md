After updating the dictionary used by my
<span class="link" data-x="0" data-y="-3">booggle</span> app, I noticed several
words had been removed. One of them was **rhinoceroi**.

# what is a dictionary?

The Oxford English Dictionary (OED) defines a dictionary as

> A book which explains or translates, usually in alphabetical order, the words
> of a language or languages (or of a particular category of vocabulary), giving
> for each word its typical spelling, an explanation of its meaning or meanings,
> and often other information, such as pronunciation, etymology, synonyms,
> equivalents in other languages, and illustrative examples. Also (from the late
> 20th cent.): an electronic resource performing this function.

But languages evolve and the words and meanings change. So who decides what a
dictionary includes at any given point in time?

If you're playing a casual game of scrabble. You might reach for the Official
Scrabble Players Dictionary (OSPD) published by Merriam-Webster.

In a tournament setting, you'll probably use either the NASPA Word List (NWL) or
Collins Scrabble Words (CSW) depending on what country you live in.

# rhinoceroi?

Yeah, so I recently updated from NWL2020 (the second edition) to NWL2023 (the
third edition) for my app. That change got rid of several words, including
rhinoceroi.

In the NWL2023 Draft Report
([pdf](https://scrabbleplayers.org/words/nwl2023/NWL2023-draft-report.pdf)),
they noted:

> “rhinocerotes” is the newly added correct Greek plural, “rhinoceroi”* was
> erroneously added to Wiktionary in 2006 and subsequently added to
> dictionary.com

If you go to dictionary.com, rhinoceroi happily gives you a "No results found"
message. But it is still live at https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/rhinoceroi and
we can see its history.

# origins

In June 2006, the user Doremítzwr added the rhinoceroi definition as an
"Etymologically correct plural of rhinoceros".

This was controversial and spawned a
[spirited discussion](https://en.m.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:Tea_room/2006#h-rhinoceros_-_plural_forms-June_2006-2006-06-30T14:09:00.000Z)
in the _Tea Room_ on what words should and should not be included in the
dictionary.

By July another user had marked it as **hypercorrect**. This was to inform
readers that while this was an attempt to follow the rules of language and be
more _correct_, the word is instead usually considered incorrect.

The list of
[hypercorrections](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Category:English_hypercorrections)
on wiktionary has additional plurals added by Doremítzwr (like avocadi, agendae,
scenarii, and platypi).

# deeper into the debate

In Jan 2007, the spirited discussion continued with
[Labelling plurals as “irregular” and/or “nonstandard”: important points from a discussion concerning the case study “scenarii”](https://en.m.wiktionary.org/wiki/Category_talk:English_nouns_with_irregular_plurals")

While that internet debate may or may not be worth your time to read, I like
EncycloPetey's point at the end that:

> What English could use is outside the scope of Wiktionary. Our goal is to
> describe what English does.
