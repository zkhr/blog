2022 saw many issues, what with the ongoing covid pandemic, tech layoffs, the
conflict in Ukraine, and more. But for me personally, it has ended on a high
being able to spend the last couple months on paternity leave with my first kid.

The internet loves lists of things, so here are three lists of random categories
for the year.

# Video Games

In 2022, I played plenty of games from past years, whether that was trying out
Seablock in Factorio, thinking I could replay FFXV before my son was born
(spoiler, he got here 2 weeks early), playing the 6.1 and 6.2 FFXIV patches,
continuing a very-long-running Gloomhaven campaign with my friends, or trying
another run of Don't Starve Together with my wife.

But, for this category we'll look specifically at my top five games that were
released in 2022.

First, in no particular order, are some runner ups. Games I still enjoyed, but
didn't make the cut:
<a class="link" data-x="2" data-y="-2">pokémon scarlet</a> the latest entry in
the long-running pokémon franchise, the tactical rpg
[Triangle Strategy](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1850510/TRIANGLE_STRATEGY/)
with the Octopath-like HD-2D visual style, the short innovative solitaire
village builder
[Stacklands](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1948280/Stacklands/), and the
donut-based puzzle game
[Freshly Frosted](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1070790/Freshly_Frosted/).

Starting at #5 is [APICO](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1390190/APICO/),
the indie beekeeping simulator. It was simultaneously super relaxing, while
remaining engaging collecting bees and mastering the mechanics of breeding and
gathering resources. Not to mention an
[awesome soundtrack](https://open.spotify.com/album/7h9h8Wl55sle1g72KRHTrU) by
Mothense.

At #4, described by Yahtzee in Zero Punctuation as a "post-dad game",
[Hardspace: Shipbreaker](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1161580/Hardspace_Shipbreaker/)
has you dismantling spaceships for parts in a dystopian capitalist scifi future.
Like APICO, both relaxing and engaging, but rather than breeding bees, the joy
came in learning the most efficient way to scrap ships and score those sweet
credits to slowly chip away at your crippling debt.

Coming in at #3 is
[Strange Horticulture](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1574580/Strange_Horticulture/),
an occult puzzle game of identifying plants and uncovering plots. I loved the
user interface of this game that left it to the player to decide how to organize
their stuff, the overall aesthetic that oozed with charm, and the thought that
clearly went into designing the different plants and their associated puzzles.

At #2 is a game that actually came out in South Korea in 2019, but made its
global debut in 2022.
[Lost Ark](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1599340/Lost_Ark/) is an Action
MMORPG with super fun combat, gorgeous locales, interesting characters, and
plenty of end-game content. It had different modes that were reminiscent of
playing Diablo, Monster Hunter, and FF14 all with the right mix of challenge and
rewards. And not to mention all the mokoko seeds and island souls to collect!

Last at #1 is
[Pokémon Legends: Arceus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pokémon_Legends:_Arceus)
which took a spin on the standard formula of catching pokemon. Running around an
open world and throwing pokemon balls at unsuspecting monsters never got old.
Here is the squad that I went with:

<div class="section pokemon-section">
  <div class="pokemon">
    <span class="mon-name">Vaporeon</span>
    <span class="detail">#134 gen i</span>

    <div class="types">
      <span class="type ground">ground</span>
      <span class="type rock">rock</span>
    </div>

  <div class="pokemon">

    <span class="detail">#475 gen iv</span>
    <div class="types">
      <span class="type psychic">psychic</span>
      <span class="type fighting">fighting</span>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

And that's it for games! Up next is TV shows!

# TV Shows

For this category, rather than shows that debuted in 2022, I'll consider any
show that released a new season in 2022. This is purely out of convenience,
since I didn't watch that many new shows this year.

In 2022, I watched a **lot** of panel shows, quiz shows, and the like, including
the newcomer The 1% Club, as well as classics like Jeopardy, Only Connect, QI, 8
out of 10 Cats Does Countdown, Would I Lie To You, and more. But in honor of
Jeremy Paxman's last season of hosting, my #5 slot goes to
[University Challenge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_Challenge).

At #4, I honor a relative newcomer to the online streaming scene with College
Humor's
[Game Changer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dropout_(streaming_platform)). With
a recurring cast of amazing comedians and incredibly clever games, this show
never disappoints. Close runners up are their game shows **Um Actually** and
**Dirty Laundry**.

Another dropout show, [Dimension 20](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension_20)
takes the #3 slot, with their 2022 release of **A Court of Fey and Flowers**
with Aabria Iyengar as GM. I was introduced to this show with **Escape from
Bloodkeep**, but between **Fantasy High** and **Misfits and Magic**, this show
has hit after hit.

At #2 is Netflix's comedy murder mystery
[Murderville](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murderville), hosted by Will Arnett.
Each episode sees a different celebrity try and solve a case, having to
improvise as they go along. With guests like Conan and Kumail Nanjiani, it was a
joy to watch. It also introduced me to Murder in Successville, which this show
was based on.

Last but not least, is my #1 pick, the new comedy action anime
[SPYxFAMILY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spy_%C3%97_Family), which sees a spy,
an assassin, a telepath, and a dog who can see the future try and avert war.
Hilarious, well animated, interesting characters. Definitely a fun new show, and
with music by **(K)now_Name** (who also did the amazing tracks for Dorohedoro),
I can't wait to see where it goes next.

And that's it for TV. Last list is food!

# Food

Speed round! With a kid on the way in 2022, we moved to have a little more space
after 3.5 years in San Mateo, CA. In honor of the town's amazing food scene,
here's a quick list of our top 10 places to grab a bite.

To leave room for the amazing places unique to San Mateo, I've left out larger
chains like Bonchon, Teaspoon, Mochinut, Curry Up Now, and more amazing spots
that are more broadly available. Also special shout out to Suruki Supermarket,
which could steal the #1 spot, but I'll keep this list to restaurants.

<ol reversed>
  <li>Jeffrey's Hamburgers</li>
  <li>Apple Fritter</li>
  <li>Ramen Dojo / Ramen Parlor</li>
  <li>Pancho Villa Taqueria</li>
  <li>Izakaya Ginji</li>
  <li>Wursthall</li>
  <li>Sichuan Chong Qing Cuisine</li>
  <li>Avenida Restaurant</li>
  <li>Pausa Bar &amp; Cookery</li>
  <li>Backhaus</li>
</ol>

Anyways, here's to a healthy and happy 2023!
