      Learning about typography can lead you to noticing things that you might
      have otherwise missed before. This can suck, like seeing
      <a href="https://xkcd.com/1015/"
        >b<span class="bad-kerning">ad ke</span>rning</a
      >
      everywhere, but it can also be fun to see the patterns in fonts used by
      restaurants, websites, movies, and more.

      I'm not an expert on this topic, but I love seeing new and interesting
      fonts and wish more sites on the internet took advantage of the variety
      out there. So to that end, I've gone ahead and updated this site to use a
      few that I like.

      Most text content is written using a font based on
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsger_W._Dijkstra"
        >Edsger W. Dijkstra's</a

      handwriting that I grabbed from

      For titles, section headers, and links around the blog, I use
      <a href="https://carlkrull.dk/">Carl Krull's</a> Traveling Typewriter
      font.

      For code, I use Ubuntu Mono, which is my favorite monospace font and the
      one I've used for
      <a href="https://github.com/zkhr/config/blob/master/dotfiles/.Xresources"
        >my terminal</a
      >
      for many years (even though Ubuntu is no longer my linux distro of
      choice). Canonical funded
      <a href="https://www.daltonmaag.com/">Dalton Maag</a> to create this font
      family for the Maverick Meerkat release in 2010.
