The last year or so has been great for the pokémon franchise with several games
hitting that nostalgic itch and innovating in interesting directions.

In April 2021,
[New Pokémon Snap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Pokémon_Snap) revisited the
best N64 rails shooter and in Jan 2022,
[Pokémon Legends: Arceus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pokémon_Legends:_Arceus)
took a spin on the standard formula.

[Pokémon Scarlet and Violet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Scarlet_and_Violet)
continue this with another solid entry in the franchise. While many reviews
rightfully criticize the performance and graphical issues, having grown up with
the graphics of n64 and gamecube games, that didn't really bother me too much.
Instead, I could enjoy a really engaging gameplay loop of just wandering around
an open world, catching pokémon, and taking down gyms.

# my squad

This time around, I tried to have a balance of pokémon from different
generations with good type coverage. Here is the lineup:

    </div>

I started with the fire croc Fuecoco, so its evolution Skeledirge was the first
pick. Running into Pawmi early on meant that of course Pawmmot would take spot
#2. I have a soft spot for any mon that can learn
[false swipe](https://www.serebii.net/attackdex-sv/falseswipe.shtml), so Scizor,
Drednaw, and Garchomp all made the cut. Finally, to round out the team with some
fairy and psychic coverage, Gardevoir took spot #6.
