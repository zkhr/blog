I don't game nearly as much these days, what with competing hobbies and
responsibilities (I'm looking at you 1473 hrs in dota 2, 402 hrs in factorio,
and however many days in ffxiv).

But, I've played a handful recently. Here are some quick thoughts in no
particular order.

# Artifacts

I hit bronze for the current season of
<a class="link" data-x="2" data-y="-7">artifacts</a> (currently at 110/200
achievement points), but my automation stalled a little bit after defeating
rosenblood.

I'll need to go back at some point and add some logic to handle everything on
Sandwhisper Isle.

# Dispatch

Back in the early 2010s, I loved the puzzles and stories that came out of
Telltale Games. Looking at my Steam history, I picked up an Indie Story Pack in
2010 that had Puzzle Agent, Puzzle Agent 2 in 2011, The Walking Dead in 2012,
The Wolf Among Us in 2014, and Tales from the Borderlands and Game of Thrones in
2015.

Now 10 years later, AdHoc Studio (made up of some ex-Telltale folks) is reviving
the genre with Dispatch, which I just finished a few nights ago.

Apparently it has
[sold really well](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/dispatch-is-on-course-to-beat-its-three-year-sales-target-in-three-months-heres-how),
which is well deserved! The story and dispatch/hacking/dialogue tree gameplay
were great, and the voice acting and animations were superb.

# Strange Antiquities

In my <a class="link" data-x="3" data-y="-5">2022 epilogue</a>, Strange
Horticulture (an occult puzzle game of identifying plants and uncovering plots)
came in as my #3 game of the year.

Yesterday, I started playing its sequel, Strange Antiquities, which with a quick
`s/plants/artifacts/` made for another fun set of puzzles.

# Tiny Bookshop

This game has you selling books out of a tiny mobile trailer. It's very cozy and
has some fun characters, but it uses real books in its gameplay and therefore
has dangerously added books to my backlog of stuff I need to read.
