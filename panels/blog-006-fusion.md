Congratulations to the folks over at [LLNL](https://www.llnl.gov/) for their
news yesterday on
[achieving fusion ignition](https://www.energy.gov/articles/doe-national-laboratory-makes-history-achieving-fusion-ignition).
From the linked announcement:

> LLNLâ€™s experiment surpassed the fusion threshold by delivering 2.05 megajoules
> (MJ) of energy to the target, resulting in 3.15 MJ of fusion energy output,
> demonstrating for the first time a most fundamental science basis for inertial
> fusion energy (IFE).

So, why is this milestone exciting? Let's dive in.

# Why pursue fusion energy?

Looking at the U.S. Energy Information Administration's
[electricity generation by energy source](https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=427&t=3)
in the United States for 2021, roughly 4.11 petawatt hours were generated with
~60% coming from fossil fuels, ~20% from nuclear energy, and ~20% from
renewables.

Fusion energy, often relegated to the realm of science fiction, has significant
advantages over the nuclear and fossil fuel categories.

In comparison to nuclear energy, there is no risk of catastrophic meltdown, the
raw materials are abundant, and the nuclear waste is minimal and decays
relatively quickly.

When considering the looming effects of climate change, traditional fossil fuels
like oil, natural gas, and coal become a lot less attractive.

So fusion energy, when available, could easily fit inside a portfolio of cleaner
energy solutions like wind, hydropower, solar, biomass, and geothermal.

# What are the ongoing fusion efforts?

One of the more popular approaches (with a few dozen around the world),
[tokamak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokamak) devices work to study fusion by
generating a powerful magnetic field to confine the fusion fuel.

On the other hand, LLNL's
[National Ignition Facility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Ignition_Facility)
(NIF) pursues fusion by means of inertial confinement (i.e. using energy from
lasers instead). I'm not a nuclear physicist, so I won't go into more details
than <b>magnets</b> vs <b>lasers</b>, but check out LLNL's article on
[How NIF Works](https://lasers.llnl.gov/about/how-nif-works) for some
interesting background.

# Yesterday's announcement and what's next

In the announcement yesterday, NIF successfully created 3.15 MJ of energy by
delivering only 2.05 MJ to the target. This is an awesome milestone, with the
big caveat that in order to deliver 2.05 MJ of energy, the laser system needed
~300 MJ from the grid.

So, what's next? Like a tech tree in a video game, achieving fusion energy as a
long-term power source requires prerequisite research advances in many areas.
How do we fire shots at a higher frequency? How can we increase the yield from
the lasers to require less energy from the grid? How do we further increase the
energy yield? And so on.

The joke has been that fusion energy is always a couple decades away, but
yesterday's milestone truly feels like we've moved one step closer. Who knows...
ask me again in 2040.
