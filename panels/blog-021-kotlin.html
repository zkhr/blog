    <div class="section">
      I started coding in Kotlin for a project recently and have mostly enjoyed
      its philosophy and syntax. But I wanted to try and articulate my thoughts
      on
      <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/docs/extensions.html#extension-functions"
        >extension functions</a
      >
      because I'm not sure yet if I like them or hate them.
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      Other languages have supported extension methods for years, but most
      projects I've worked on have been in languages without support (or at
      least without idiomatic usage).
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      The super quick overview is that they let you add methods directly on
      classes that can be imported independently of the original code. Read the
      docs linked above for a better description.
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      I think I instinctively hated them, because coming from something like
      javascript where this would be done via modifying the prototype, you have
      no guarantees that you aren't clobbering some other code on the page. Or
      with something like dependency injection where your framework makes data
      available for you, but it isn't always easy to know where things are
      coming from without decent tooling or prior knowledge of the codebase.
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      But neither of these are concerns in Kotlin. Handling for extension
      functions occurs at compile time, so you don't have the same concerns
      around breaking other parts of the codebase. And extensions are imported
      so its easy to find where they source from.
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      I guess there is a worry that a poorly organized codebase could become
      even more cumbersome to work with if past authors scattered different
      parts of an object around incomprehensibly. But this seems like it would
      be easy enough to reconcile and reason through.
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      On the flip side, I like the syntactic sugar it brings and the simplicity
      of adding utility functions on top of core functionality that I don't own.
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      So I guess it's just the change aversion that comes with learning
      something new. They'll probably grow on me as I learn all the shiny new
      best practices that make use of them.
